===========

Creating a simple Conway's Game of Life on an FPGA.
Works on a Xilinx Nexys4 board.
The VGA output is set at 640x480 but only uses a portion of the screen so we would not have to stretch.
Also has a Block RAM and Shift Register implementation.

Worked on this project in university in a group of 3 people (GÃ¡bor & Joe).
Thanks guys.
